## Why take on this project?
I wanted to develop this project so I would have the ability to keep track of habits I'm trying to develop or get rid of bad habits while having a visual sense of how I'm progressing so far. I was able to hone my front-end skills as well as my back-end Psql database.

## Known Bugs / Unsolved Problems
* When resizing the browser window the calendar is stacked on top of the habits, this is due to my choice of using the absolute positioning for my calendar. 

* Only able to see highest streak for current month
